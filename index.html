      <p>Hi, I recenetly graduated from the University Of Washington's Coding Bootcamp. I would love to continue my education and get a Masters in Computer Science. </p>

      <p>I love Front End Web Development but I would really like to learn more about the back end. I have completed three group projects and numerous homework and activity assignments which I have linked in my portfolio.</p>
